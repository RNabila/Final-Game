# Peacefomers: Collect Resources and Distribute!
In this strategy-based game, the player must collect as many resources and distribute them in order to raise equality levels of 5 different regions. They must collect trash, and keep track of how many wood and water they have in their inventory. Equality for all regions and prudent resource management are the keys to vicotry!

## Objective

The goal of the game is to collect starlings and resources while improving the equality levels of different regions. Players must allocate resources, collect trash, and manage their inventory to bring harmony to all regions. The game ends when:

**Win Condition:** All regions reach an equality/resources score of 80 or more.

**Lose Condition:** Any region's equality/resources score drops to 0.(It is hard to lose, it would have to be a random event.)

## Features of the Game

- **Regions:** Region A, Region B, Region C, Region D, and Region E are the five regions in the game. The initial equality score for each region is 50. Distributing resources is necessary to raise their equality ratings.
  
- **Resources:** The player has one hundred resources at the beginning. Trash collection might boost the amount of resources that are allocated to different locations.
  
- **Trash:** Items in the trash show up on the screen at random. They provide resources and starlings (scoring) to the player when they are gathered.
  
- **Starlings:** Starlings are used to track the player's score. The player receives starlings for gathering rubbish. To win, the player requires thirty starlings.
  
- **Inventory:** Water and wood, which are kept in the inventory, are available for the player to gather. Eighty is the maximum inventory capacity.
  
- **Random Events:** Random events can affect regions positively or negatively, influencing equality scores.

### Key Features

- **Trash Collection:** Collect trash items on the screen to gain starlings and resources.
  
- **Resource Distribution/Allocation:** Use resources to increase equality in regions. The player can choose which region to allocate resources to by clicking the respective buttons.
  
- **Inventory Management:** Collect wood and water to manage resources in your inventory.
  
- **Random Events:** Random events affect the equality levels of regions, either giving a bonus or a penalty, and sometimes providing additional resources.
  
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends when either the player wins or loses. The game can be restarted at any time.
