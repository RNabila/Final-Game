# Peaceformers: The Quest for Equality

## Overview
**Peaceformers: The Quest for Equality** is a strategy-based simulation game where the player must balance resources to improve the equality levels of different regions. The player must collect trash, allocate resources, and manage an inventory of wood and water, all while ensuring their starlings score increases. Victory is achieved by bringing equality to all regions while managing resources wisely. The game provides an interactive GUI to track progress and events, and is controlled using keyboard and in-game buttons.

## Gameplay

### Objective
The goal of the game is to collect starlings and resources while improving the equality levels of different regions. Players must allocate resources, collect trash, and manage their inventory to bring harmony to all regions. The game ends when:
- **Win Condition**: All regions reach an equality score of 80 or more.
- **Lose Condition**: Any region's equality score drops to 0.

### Game Elements
- **Regions**: There are 5 regions in the game (Region A, Region B, Region C, Region D, and Region E). Each region starts with an equality score of 50. You must allocate resources to increase their equality scores.
- **Resources**: The player starts with 100 resources. Resources are used to allocate to regions and can be increased by collecting trash.
- **Trash**: Trash items appear randomly on the screen. When collected, they give the player starlings (score) and resources.
- **Starlings**: The player's score is tracked through starlings. Collecting trash gives the player starlings. The player needs 30 starlings to win.
- **Inventory**: The player can collect wood and water, which are stored in the inventory. The maximum inventory capacity is 80.
- **Random Events**: Random events can affect regions positively or negatively, influencing equality scores.

### Key Features
1. **Trash Collection**: Collect trash items on the screen to gain starlings and resources.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Use resources to increase equality in regions. The player can choose which region to allocate resources to by clicking the respective buttons.
3. **Inventory Management**: Collect wood and water to manage resources in your inventory.
4. **Random Events**: Random events affect the equality levels of regions, either giving a bonus or a penalty, and sometimes providing additional resources.
5. **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when either the player wins or loses. The game can be restarted at any time.
